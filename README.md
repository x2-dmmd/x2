## About

x2 (Pronounced "ex-two") is a high-level, interpreted language written in Python by [iiPython](https://github.com/ii-Python/) with low-level programming language syntax, such as [x86 Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language) or [Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file).

x2 contains features such as:
- Automatic Garbage Collection
- Scoped/Global Variables
- Public/Private Sections
- Functions and Methods
- Python Integration
- Working Import/Export System
- Package System
- ...And more!

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Installation

First and foremost, make sure you have [Python](https://python.org/downloads/) (Minimum Python 3.10 | Recommended Python 3.11) installed on your device. You can check if you have Python installed by opening up a terminal and typing:

```
python -V
```

It is extremely recommended to have a text editor or Integrated Development Environment, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as its built-in development tools and add-ons will speed up and facilitate your development process. However, a simple text editor like notepad is sufficient.

Next, visit our [github repository](https://github.com/ii-Python/x2/) and download a clone of the repository by clicking on the green `Code ▾` button and the `Download ZIP` option. Optionally, if you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your device, you can also clone the repository by opening up a terminal and typing:

```
git clone https://github.com/ii-Python/x2/
```

If you are choosing Visual Studio Code as your Integrated Development Environment, you can also install the [x2 extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iiPython.x2) on the marketplace to get syntax highlighting on your x2 files.

### Step 2: Set-Up

Once you open up your x2 project, you should be able to find a file named `main.xt`. By default, this is your main entry file and is where you will be writing your x2 code. Within the file, you should see:

```xt
:: Main
:main
    out "Hello, world!"
```

Any x2 files should always end in the `.xt` extension. The main entry file should also always contain a `:main` section.

You can edit the main entry file by editing the configuration in `.xtconfig`. It is a JSON-like file that contains all the configurations for your x2 project. Within it, you should see:

```xtconfig
{
    "main": "main.xt"
}
```

> You can learn more about setting up your project in the [tutorials](./md/tutorials.md).

### Step 3: Execution

After you are done writing your x2 code, you can execute your x2 project immediately by opening up a terminal and typing:

```
python main.py .
```

Currently, you should see the terminal output:

```
"Hello, world!"
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why is it called x2?

It originally started as `x` because the name sounded cool. As development goes on, a second revision was published and the name was changed to `x2`.

### Q: Can I use x2 for data management, game design, or simply for fun?

You can pretty much do anything in vanilla x2, especially with the `evl` operator, which allows you to integrate Python into your project.

### Q: Where can I publish my games / packages?

You can publish your games and packages at [our website](https://x2.iipython.cf/)!
