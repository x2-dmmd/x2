## About

x2 is a minimalistic and open source programming language created by [**iiPython**](https://github.com/ii-Python/). Its syntaxes and behaviors are heavily inspired by the famous programming languages [**x86 Assembly**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language/) and [**Batch**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file/). x2 is a [**high-level programming languages**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language/) with syntaxes from [**low-level programming languages**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language/), similar to [**x86 Assembly**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language/).

## Installation

x2 uses a [**Python**](https://python.org/) interpreter to execute the files. A minimum version of `Python 3.9.1` or higher (`Python 3.10.x` is recommended) is required to run an x2 file. You can download Python [**here**](https://www.python.org/downloads/)!

You can also check your current version of Python by typing the following into a terminal:

```
python -V
```

Next, clone the [**x2 repository**](https://github.com/ii-Python/x2/) either by clicking green `Code ▾` button and then `Download ZIP` or by typing the following into a terminal if you have [**git**](https://git-scm.com/):

```
git clone https://github.com/ii-Python/x2/
```

## Basics

An x2 file can have any name and should end in the extension name `.xt`. By default, the entry point of an x2 project should be named `main.xt`. However, that can be changed within the `config.json` file.

Below is an example of a `Hello, World!` written in x2:

```xt
:main
    out "Hello, World!"
```

To execute an x2 file, simply run the `main.py` file by typing the following into a terminal:

```
python main.py main.xt
```
